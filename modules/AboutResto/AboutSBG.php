    Opened on December 2012, Food For Thought at the Gardens is inspired by the Singapore Botanic Gardensâ€™ mission to connect people with the pleasures of nature.
    <br><br>
    Situated within the oldest and most historically significant garden of our busy city, we designed our restaurant around love for family, care for the environment, enjoyment of rest and other aspects of truly sustainable living.  
    <br><br>
    Surrounded by lush greenery, our 300-seater eco-conscious restaurant features upcycled milk-tin lamps and full-height glass walls that let in plenty of natural light. To encourage family and community bonding, we designed our space for inclusivity. Large tables, generous aisles, a safely enclosed playground and a wheelchair allow us to serve visitors from all walks of life.
    <br><br>
    Come treat yourself to local comfort food like mee rebus after your morning workout. Bond with family over brunch favourites like creamy scrambled eggs, gula melaka granola and pulled pork burgers. Journal quietly with coffee and a freshly baked cranberry raisin scone. Or just kick back at the end of the day with friends over wine and creamy pesto chicken linguine. 
    <br><br>
    There is always time to taste the good life.
